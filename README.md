# campdao-client-extension
This repo contains all files to customize and extend the eosdac-client for CampDAO.

## branding
You can change the default colors via the theme.json file found in statics/config/theme.json. You can generate and download your custom theme file by enabling the "dev tools" on the settings page. The logos for the eosdac-client will be pulled in from branding/images/logos. Be aware that the file names must match the original.
